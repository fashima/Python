<h1>Python Projects</h1>

<h2>[Project 001] Simple Password Validator</h2>
<p>I wrote this program to validate a password using While loop.</p>
<h2>[Project 002] Sum Program</h2>
<p>I wrote this program to ask the user how many integers he wants and the program will add the numbers and show the result</p>
<h2>[Project 003] Simple Calculator program</h2>
<p>I wrote this program asking the user to enter two numbers and select the math operation</p>
<p><b>Updated:</b>28/10/2023 - I refactored the calculator program, which was a little more complex than the previous model. In this model, when the mathematical operation is finished and the user decides to perform a new operation, the menu is cleared thanks to Python's "os" library.</p>
<h2>[Project 004] While Advance</h2>
<p>I have designed this program to operate with a While loop of greater complexity. Now, I have two variables (x and y); as variable x is incremented, variable y is simultaneously decremented.</p>
<h2>[Project 005] Bank Account</h2>
<p>I designed this program to simulate a simple ATM operation. There are 4 actions built with if/else condition and while loop. One of my favorite projects so far</p>
<h2>[Project 006] Bible Verses Generator</h2>
<p>As a Christian, my heart delights in God. For a long time I think about what I can create to honor and share God's word. This simple program is one of the answers to this search.</p>
<h2>[Project 007] Password Generator</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, Internet users are unable to create strong passwords. I have seen many reports in the news about people being hacked every day and the most common mistake they make is a weak password. I developed this program to help people create a better password.</p>
<h2>[Project 008] BR Employee Payroll</h2>
<p>One of the most difficult projects I've had to do. Calculating an employee's payroll following Brazilian legislation is very difficult and complex. I used the if/else statement a lot and I know I need to refactor this code, perhaps creating functions to do most of the calculation, but I don't have consistent knowledge about it, and understanding the calculation and translating it to the computer was the highlight of this project . Victory!!!</p>
